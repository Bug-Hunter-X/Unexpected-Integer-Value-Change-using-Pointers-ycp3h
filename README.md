# Unexpected Integer Value Change using Pointers
This repository demonstrates a common C programming error involving integer pointers. The code appears simple, but it highlights a subtle issue that can lead to unexpected behavior. 
The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.c` file provides the corrected version and explanation.
The core problem involves understanding how pointers work in C and how changing the value pointed to directly affects the original variable.
